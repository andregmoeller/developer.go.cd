## Overview of task plugins

Go's user documentation has an overview of task plugins. Please see [that](https://docs.gocd.org/current/extension_points/task_extension.html).

Go provides two ways of writing a task plugin:
* [JSON API - Message based](json_message_based_task_extension.md)
* [Java API based (Deprecated)](writing_go_task_plugins.md)
