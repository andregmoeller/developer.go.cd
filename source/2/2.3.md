## 2.3 How to add a configuration migration

The Go configuration XML file is a very important part of Go. When adding new features or changing existing features, sometimes there will be a need to add/remove/modify certain sections of it. Since existing configuration XMLs should continue to work, even for existing users, a "configuration migration" will need to be added to migrate old XMLs.

The configuration XML has a schema version, and configuration migration scripts correspond to that version. These scripts use XSL transformations, and below is a quick guide on how to add a new configuration migration.

> Assuming for example that
> * the current schema version is 71, and there's a config migration that removes the `<license/>` element. Here are the steps you would perform:
> * The project working directory is `~/projects/go`

#### Step 1: Run an automated script to bump schema version

```bash
~/projects/go$ ./gradlew -q server:bumpSchemaVersion
Now edit the file ~/projects/go/config/config-server/resources/upgrades/72.xsl
```

> This automated script will actually create and update a few files â€”

```bash
$ git status -s
 M base/src/com/thoughtworks/go/util/GoConstants.java
 M config/config-server/resources/cruise-config.xsd
?? config/config-server/resources/schemas/71_cruise-config.xsd
?? config/config-server/resources/upgrades/72.xsl
```

#### Step 2: Add XSL to transform the cruise-config.xml to from one version to the next

Edit the file that was printed on the console and perform the necessary migration.

```bash
~/projects/go$ vim ~/projects/go/config/config-server/resources/upgrades/72.xsl
```

The 72.xsl transformation looks like

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
    <xsl:template match="/cruise/@schemaVersion">
        <xsl:attribute name="schemaVersion">72</xsl:attribute>
    </xsl:template>
    <!-- Copy everything -->
    <xsl:template match="@*|node()" name="identity">
        <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
        </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>
    <!-- Remove matching node "<license>" -->
    <xsl:template match="//license" />
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

### 2.3.2 Testing the newly added migration

Configuration migration tests can be found in ```com.thoughtworks.go.config.GoConfigMigrationIntegrationTest```. For example, a test to verify schema version 72 is written as follows.

```java
@Test
public void shouldRemoveLicenseSection_asPartOfMigration72() throws Exception {
    String licenseUser = "Go UAT ThoughtWorks";
    String configWithLicenseSection =
            "<cruise schemaVersion='71'>"+
                "<server artifactsdir='logs' commandRepositoryLocation='default' serverId='dev-id'>" +
                    "   <license user='licenseuser'>"+
                    "       Hq6o5X...." +
                    "   </license>" +
                "  </server>" +
            "</cruise>";

    String migratedContent = migrateXmlString(configWithLicenseSection, 71);
    assertThat(migratedContent, not(containsString("license")));
    assertThat(migratedContent, not(containsString("licenseuser")));
}
```
