## 2.4 How to add a database migration

Similar to configuration, from time to time, the Go database needs to be migrated as well, to accommodate new features or other changes. Go uses [DBDeploy](https://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/) to perform this operation.

> Explaining by example, I'll take the case of how the database migration 1701001 was added

### 2.4.1 Introducing a new database migration

```shell
~/projects/go$ ./gradlew server:createDbMigration -PmigrationName=remove_gadget_oauth_tables -q
Creating new migration:
    ~/projects/go/server/db/migrate/h2deltas/1701001_remove_gadget_oauth_tables.sql
```

The above file will create a file with the following convention:

```
<2-digit-major-release-version><2-digit-minor-release-version><3-digit-migration-sequence-number>_<description-of-the-migration>.sql
```

For example, for the first migration of 17.1 release, the migration was

```bash
~/projects/go$ touch ./server/db/migrate/h2deltas/1701001_remove_gadget_oauth_tables.sql
```

- 2-digit-major-release-version : **17**
- 2-digit-minor-release-version : **01**
- 3-digit-migration-sequence-number: **001**
- description-of-the-migration: **remove_gadget_oauth_tables**

### 2.4.2 Writing the DML/DDL

Following the DBDeploy [semantics](https://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/wiki/GettingStarted), the 1701001 migration was created as

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS gadgetOauthAuthorizationCodes;
...

--//@UNDO

CREATE TABLE gadgetOauthClients (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1) PRIMARY KEY,
  oauthAuthorizeUrl VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  clientId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  clientSecret VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  serviceName VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
);
```

If you now run

```bash
./gradlew prepare
```

and then bring up a Development Server, you will see that the migration runs.
