# Task plugin - Java API based (Deprecated)

The objective of this guide is to explain how to write a [task plugin](task_plugin_overview.md), for Go.

Useful references:
* [Overview of task plugins - External link to Go's user documentation ](https://docs.gocd.org/current/extension_points/task_extension.html)
* [Structure of a plugin and writing one](../go_plugins_basics.md)
* [A sample task plugin - curl](https://github.com/gocd/sample-plugins/tree/master/curl-plugin-old-api-based)

## Note
Go is moving towards [JSON message based plugin API](../json_message_based_plugin_api.md), java API based plugin will be deprecated soon. Refer [Writing a JSON message package material plugin](json_message_based_task_extension.md) instead.

### Interface

Creating a task plugin involves implementing a few interfaces, which are described below. If you need to know the basics of writing a plugin in Go, read [this](../go_plugins_basics.md). The concepts and processes mentioned there apply to the task plugin end-point as well. On that page, you can also find the go-plugin-api.jar file which contains the interfaces mentioned below.

#### Task

The Task interface is the starting point of the task plugin end-point. It is the top-level interface that needs to be implemented. However, to implement the methods in it, you will need to be aware of a few other interfaces and classes.

#### TaskConfig

TaskConfig is a class, which is used by the plugin to define the set of configuration properties accepted and expected by it.

![](../../images/TaskConfig.png)

As shown above, it has an addProperty method, which is usually used to add information about a configuration property. You can also provide a default value for a property. It will be used if the user does not provide any value for it. It can be setup this way (inside the config() method of your plugin's task implementation):

```
config.addProperty("MyProperty).withDefault("DEFAULT VALUE");
```

#### TaskView

The TaskView implementation provided by the plugin defines the UI part of the configuration. The template() method returns a string, which is written in HTML with Angular.js-specific elements. Every configuration property specified by the TaskConfig mentioned earlier, will be available as a variable, which can be used in the template.

![](../../images/TaskView.png)

You can read more about Go's use of Angular.js templates [here](../angular_js_templates_in_go_plugins.md).

#### TaskExecutor

The TaskExecutor implementation provided by the plugin (and its execute() method, actually) is the one that gets called, on an agent, when the plugin task needs to be executed.

![](../../images/TaskExecutor.png)

The execute() method gets called with two arguments:

-   TaskConfig: This TaskConfig object is related to the one specified in the config() method in the Task Interface, but differs in that it contains the value of the property, specified by the user, as well.
-   TaskExecutionContext: This object contains contextual information related to this run of the task. It is explained in a bit more detail below.

#### TaskExecutionContext

The TaskExecutionContext is provided by Go, when the execute() method of TaskExecutor is called on the agent, when a task needs to be run.

![](../../images/TaskExecutionContext.png)

### Writing a simple task plugin

You can find the source of the sample Curl plugin mentioned earlier, [at this location](../go_plugins_basics.md#building_a_plugin).

Let's see what it takes to implement a simple task plugin, one which takes a message from the user, and when executed, echoes that message back. We need to start with a Task interface implementation, with the config() method specifying the "message" field and the view() method specifying a UI for it. Do not forget to annotate the class with @Extension annotation, as specified in the [Go plugin basics page](../go_plugins_basics.md).

#### Version 1 - No validation

For version 1 of this plugin, we will ignore the validate() method. The code looks like this:

``` {.code}
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.annotation.Extension;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.response.execution.ExecutionResult;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.response.validation.ValidationResult;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.task.*;

@Extension
public class EchoTask implements Task {
  private static final String MESSAGE_KEY = "message";

  @Override
  public TaskConfig config() {
    TaskConfig config = new TaskConfig();
    config.addProperty(MESSAGE_KEY).withDefault("NO MESSAGE");
    return config;
  }

  @Override
  public TaskView view() {
    return new TaskView() {
      @Override
      public String displayValue() {
        return "Echo";
      }

      @Override
      public String template() {
        return "<div class=\"form_item_block\">\n" +
                "  <label>Message:<span class=\"asterisk\">*</span>\n" +
                "      <input type=\"text\" ng-model='" + MESSAGE_KEY + "' ng-required=\"true\">\n" +
                "  </label>\n" +
                "</div>\n";
      }
    };
  }

  @Override
  public ValidationResult validate(TaskConfig configuration) {
    return new ValidationResult(); // No errors added to it.
  }

  @Override
  public TaskExecutor executor() {
    return new TaskExecutor() {
        @Override
        public ExecutionResult execute(TaskConfig config, TaskExecutionContext context) {
          context.console().printLine("Message is: " + config.getValue(MESSAGE_KEY));
          return ExecutionResult.success("Finished running echo plugin!");
        }
    };
  }
}
```

Now, the dropdown and configuration UI look like this:

![](../../images/EchoTask.png)

The output of the task, when it runs, looks like this:

``` {.code}
[go] Start to execute task: Plugin with ID: echo.task.plugin.
Message is: Test
```

#### Version 2 - With validation

Let's add a validation to the save, so that only messages with length 5 are allowed. To do this, we need to add a validation error when a message which is not of length 5 is entered. Also, we need to change the template so that it can show an error. The code looks like this:

``` {.code}
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.annotation.Extension;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.response.execution.ExecutionResult;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.response.validation.ValidationError;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.response.validation.ValidationResult;
import com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.task.*;

@Extension
public class EchoTask implements Task {
  private static final String MESSAGE_KEY = "message";

  @Override
  public TaskConfig config() {
    TaskConfig config = new TaskConfig();
    config.addProperty(MESSAGE_KEY).withDefault("NO MESSAGE");
    return config;
  }

  @Override
  public TaskView view() {
    return new TaskView() {
      @Override
      public String displayValue() {
        return "Echo";
      }

      @Override
      public String template() {
        return "<div class='form_item_block'>\n" +
            "  <label>Message:<span class='asterisk'>*</span></label>\n" +
            "    <input type='text' ng-model='" + MESSAGE_KEY + "' />\n" +
            "    <span class='form_error' ng-show='GOINPUTNAME[" + MESSAGE_KEY + "].$error.server'>{{ GOINPUTNAME[" + MESSAGE_KEY + "].$error.server }}</span>\n" +
            "</div>\n";
      }
    };
  }

  @Override
  public ValidationResult validate(TaskConfig configuration) {
    ValidationResult result = new ValidationResult();

    String message = configuration.getValue(MESSAGE_KEY);
    if (message == null || message.length() != 5) {
      result.addError(new ValidationError(MESSAGE_KEY, "Only messages of length 5 allowed."));
    }

    return result;
  }

  @Override
  public TaskExecutor executor() {
    return new TaskExecutor() {
      @Override
      public ExecutionResult execute(TaskConfig config, TaskExecutionContext context) {
        context.console().printLine("Message is: " + config.getValue(MESSAGE_KEY));
        return ExecutionResult.success("Finished running echo plugin!");
      }
    };
  }
}
```

Now, the configuration UI looks like this, when trying to save a message which is not of length 5:
